# Comment:
# This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to check if there is a path from the root to a leaf node
# that sums up to the target sum.
# At each node, we subtract the node's value from the target sum and recursively check if the left or right subtree
# has a path that sums up to the remaining target sum.
# If the current node is a leaf node and its value is equal to the remaining target sum, we return Trueï¼Œotherwise False.
# The method to check if a node is a leaf node is to check if it is not none an has no left and right children.

# If either subtree has such a path, we return True.
# If neither subtree has such a path, we return False.
# The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
# The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursion stack.
