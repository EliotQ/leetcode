# Summary

In this camp, we have learned common data structures and algorithms. And going through the process has given me a holistic education on the topic. I have learned how to implement these data structures and algorithms in Python, and I have also learned how to analyze their time complexity. 

Yet I still have a lot to learn. I will continue to practice and improve my skills in this area.

Some points I'd improve on:
- I have skipped some of the exercises in the camp. I will go back and complete them.
- I need more mock interviews to improve my think-out-loud skills.
- For the graph algorithms, I need to practice more to get a better understanding of them.
